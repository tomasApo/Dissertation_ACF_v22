\section{How does Autocorrelation work?}
Autocorrelation is matching a signal compared to a delayed version of itself. This delay between the original signal and the delay is called ‘lag'. 

``The autocorrelation \cite{Jenkins} function can be used for the following two purposes:

\begin{itemize}

    \item To detect non-randomness in data.
    
    \item To identify an appropriate time series model if the data are not random.
    
\end{itemize}

Given measurements, Y1, Y2, ..., YN at time X1, X2, ..., XN, the lag k autocorrelation function is defined as
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering

\begin{math}
{ {r_{k} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N-k}(Y_{i} - \bar{Y})(Y_{i+k} -  \bar{Y})} {\sum_{i=1}^{N}(Y_{i} - \bar{Y})^{2} }} }
\end{math}

\caption{Autocorrelation Formula}
\label{autocorrolationF}
\end{figure}

Although the time variable, X, is not used in the formula for Autocorrelation, the assumption is that the observations are equispaced.

Autocorrelation is a correlation coefficient. However, instead of a correlation between two different variables, the correlation is between two values of the same variable at times Xi and Xi+k.

In our case we use Autocorrelation to identify an appropriate time series model, hence we plot with many lags." \cite{NIST}

\subsection{How does this apply?}

The Autocorrelation coefficient has now been explained mathematically, but how is this shown graphically? 
Looking at Figure \ref{ACF coefficient} and starting on the Y axis, the scale goes from -1 to 1, 1 = 100\% match and 0 = 0\% correlated while -1 equating to an anti-phase sort of cycle matching.
The X axis is the length of time the dataset but it is shown in datapoint numbers. If the dataset is 10,000 datapoints long, the x axis autocorrelation coefficient graph will shown 10,000 as the maximum value. The peaks with the red crosses seen on the graph is what the script looks for when identifying representative cycles.

\section{Other methods of pattern recognition}
Before diving into the different types of pattern recognition and approaches. All methods need to follow the diagram´s approach to be considered. Using the database produced by Julien Siebert, Janek Groß, and Christof Schro  \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2104-07406}, a table was made for time series data, allowing users to filter by task required. In our case pattern recognition but other classification methods were available like forecasting, classification,	clustering,	anomaly detection... Below is a list of all the libraries that fit the reports needs ``pattern recognition".

\subsection{Stumpy}
On 17 Jul 2019, stumpy library was created. This library was born from the essential research created by the  University of New Mexico, Riverside and the University of California. It ``described an exact method called STOMP for computing the matrix profile for any time series with a computational complexity of O(n2)!" \cite{law2019stumpy} 

\subsubsection{Matrix profile} 
The STUMPY library efficiently computes a matrix profile, a vector that stores the z-normalized Euclidean distance in between subsequences in a time series and its nearest neighbour. Target market is academics, data scientists, and developers. Open-sourced STUMPY, is a strong and scalable library that efficiently computes the matrixprofile according to this published study \cite{law2019stumpy}. If the reader wishes to dive deeper into the technicalities of z-normalized Euclidean distance, they can read the best paper award winner from ICDM 2017.\cite{zhu_imamura_nikovski_keogh_2017}.

\subsubsection{How can Stumpy be implemented for pattern recognition?}
Utilizing dataset A with STUMP function, the graphs in Figure \ref{Motif} were produced.
The Y axis is the z-normalized Euclidean distance shown on the bottom plot. The higher the value, the lower the ``correlation". This is illustrated by the best cycles selected, starting at the lowest points on the Matrix profile.

To automatically select the lowest point on the Matrix profile, a NumPy sorting algorithm is used to select the first point.

\begin{python}
motif_idx = np.argsort(mp[:, 0])[0]
print(f"The motif is located at index {motif_idx}")
\end{python}
The motif is located at index 85062

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.40]{images/Motif (Pattern) Discovery.png}
\caption{Motif (Pattern) Discovery}
\label{Motif}
\end{figure}
According to the documentation \cite{law2019stumpy}, to select a complete cycle the user must select the lowest point in the Matrix profile, and then add the rough length of the pattern to create the start and endpoint of the cycle.

Requiring the knowledge of the cycle length prior to running the program highlighted a major problem with stumpy. This problem means that the stumpy library cannot be used if the engineer does not know the cycle length they are after. 
\begin{python}
length = 4000
mp = stumpy.stump(datasetA['mm'], length)

\end{python}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.40]{images/DatasetA.png}

\end{figure}

\subsection{pyts}
"pyts "is a Python library specialized in classifying time series. It seeks to make time series classification more accessible by offering preprocessing and utility tools, as well as implementations of multiple time series classification algorithms. The package includes several unit tests, and continuous integration ensures backward compatibility and code integration. The package is released under the BSD licence with three clauses.  \cite{JMLR:v21:19-763}


Unfortunately, after researching and testing the tool to see its application, it has been discovered that it does not fit the requirements. The `pyst' library uses machine learning that requires training samples before running the actual time series data, and under the methodology of the report, no training samples are provided. the function also has to find `a representative cycle' with only 1 dataset, and even though it markets itself as pattern recognition (confirmed in database paper \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2104-07406}), the`pyst' library fails to do so 

\subsection{matrixprofile}

Here is yet another library based on the z-normalized Euclidean distance papers \cite{zhu_imamura_nikovski_keogh_2017}. 
MatrixProfile is a Python 3 library, produced by the Matrix Profile Foundation, specifically for timeseries doing data mining. The Matrix Profile is a novel data structure with accompanying algorithms (regimes, stomp, motifs, etc.) created by the research groups of Keogh and Mueen at UC-Riverside and the University of New Mexico. MatrixProfile objective is to make these algorithms accessible to both beginners and experts by standardisation of basic principles, a straightforward API, and good documentation \cite{Van_Benschoten2020} 

Unfortunately, at the time of this report Python 3.10 is not supported stopping the author from using the CAT machine datasets for this library. Fortunately the article \cite{Van_Benschoten2020} provides Figure \ref{matrixTable} of the results from a NYC taxi dataset, whereby results seem promising for the report with an interesting automatic Discord identifier. Discord being defined as ``A time series discord indicates a subsequence with the maximum distance to its neighbor in the given time series data, which means abnormal or unusual data trends."\cite{woodbridge_wilson_rintoul_goldstein_2015}

\end{figure}

\subsection{tslearn}
tslearn is another library based on the Scikit-learn platform. A trendy Python package for machine learning. Unfortunately, this library has the same issue as matrixprofile. It relies on training data for the AI to practice before running through the main dataset. No training data is allowed in the report's case, making the tslearn library unsuitable.
